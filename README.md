# Maze Generating Program

This is a maze generating program written in Python using the recursive backtracking algorithm.

### Features:
---
User Input: This is a normal feature. The program uses a rudimentary command line menu that the user can use numbers to select which option they desire.

History: After creating a maze, the user can then create multiple more and the program will save up to 10 different mazes that the user can download.

Different download types: Since this program was developed due to my other C++ program requiring a text version of the maze, I have given the program the ability to save mazes in text and picture formats. However the picture format may be extremely small due to each path and wall being 1px*1px.

Resizing option: Because each maze is extremely small, I have also added the ability to resize mazes based on a number that the user provides. For example, inputting 2 will double the size of the paths and walls, and inputting 10 will increase the size by a tenfold.
